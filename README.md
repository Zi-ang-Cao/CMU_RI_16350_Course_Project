## Tips for Setup

### [turtlebot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)


### Github
* Edit the `.gitignore` to skip any file that is larger than 100M. (Mainly the zip for backup purpose.)
```Shell
ls -a

# [Option1] Open with any GUI textEditor -- Sublime Text for me
open .gitignore -a "Sublime Text"

# [Option2] Edit in terminal
vi .gitignore
# For quickly adding a single line to an existing file
echo 'backup/xxx.zip' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### ROS
* Please refer to [RoboStack](https://robostack.github.io/index.html) for additional help
